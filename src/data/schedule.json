Less than a year later, in 2009, Ryan Dahl announced (at this very conference!) a way to run the V8 browser environment outside of the browser- Node.js, a platform that held the promise of unifying web application development, where both client and server side development could happen in the same language - JavaScript.</p><p>A decade later, V8, JavaScript, and its new buddy WebAssembly, have expanded to lands charted only a few years after Node.js debuted- known (confusingly) as the &#x201C;Edge&#x201D;. In this talk, we&#x2019;ll introduce what the &#x201C;Edge&#x201D; is and why we are excited for it to revolutionize computation on the web. We&#x2019;ll explore how this adventurous JavaScript engine, V8, is so well suited to tasks previously limited to Virtual Machines, Containers, or even simply Operating Systems. Finally, we&#x2019;ll talk about security, Spectre, and ask ourselves the age old question, &#x201C;You can do it, but should you?&#x201D;.</p><p>In true JSConf EU tradition, this talk itself is going be an exciting announcement. You should come if you want to be there for the beginning of a new era of the Internet.</p><p><a href=\"https://2019.jsconf.eu/ashley-williams/javascripts-journey-to-the-edge.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">More info</a></p>"

But that&#x2019;s not the case with frameworks. Developers who use frameworks expect them to run as fast as possible. In fact, speed is often a defining characteristic when choosing a framework. There are techniques that make code run faster. You&#x2019;ve probably heard about linked lists, monomorphism and bitmasks, right? Maybe you&#x2019;ve even used some. Well, you can find all these and a bunch of other interesting approaches in the sources of most popular JS frameworks. Over the past year I&#x2019;ve seen a lot while reverse-engineering Angular and React. In this talk I want to share my findings with you. Some of you may end up applying them at work.
